# Language-Detection-using-Basic-Machine-Learning-Algorithms:

This project implements Language Detection using a Logistic Regression model. The text is preprocessed (removing symbols, numbers, converting to lowercase), then transformed into a **Bag-of-Words** model using `CountVectorizer`.  The trained Logistic Regression model predicts the language of a given text. 

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- Regex (for text preprocessing)

## Dataset : 
The dataset used for training and testing was imported from "Kaggle".
