# Language-Detection-using-Basic-Machine-Learning-Algorithms-
This project implements Language Detection using a Logistic Regression model. The text is preprocessed (removing symbols, numbers, converting to lowercase), then transformed into a **Bag-of-Words** model using `CountVectorizer`.   The trained Logistic Regression model predicts the language of a given text.
